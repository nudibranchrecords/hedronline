/** HEDRON TIP **
This is a nice and simple sketch to get you going!
A polyhedron that can spin on all axes. The user can change the speed of the rotation.
The user can change the scale. The user can also click on "shapeshift" and the geometry changes.

      sketchesFolder - The path to the sketches folder on your computer.

    The update method is called every frame by Hedron.
    You have the following arguments to make use of...

    ownParams: An object containing params defined in config.js.
    These are values between 0 and 1 that can be manipulated in many ways by the user.

    time: Elapsed time in ms (not used below)

    frameDiff: Number of frames that should have passed since last frame.
    Useful for keeping speeds consistent.
    If the framerate changes, this value changes too. At 60fps the value will be
    exactly 1. Less than 60fps and the value goes above 1. More than 60fps and the value
    goes below 1. See below on how it can be used.

    allParams: An object containing all params from all sketches. (not used below)

      the "Rotation Speed X" param (defined in config.js), it will change here and the
      speed increases. We're multiplying the final increase by 'frameDiff'
      so that the speed stays consistent across varying framerates.
