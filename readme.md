# HedrOnline

An easy way to get your Hedron sketches up and running on the web. This is in the very early stages of development so is subject to many changes. Right now this is more of a boilerplate, but eventually will be released on npm, with a boilerplate in a separate repo.

## Getting started

Install:

```bash
npm install
```

Start server on `http://localhost:8080/`:

```bash
npm start
```

Check index.js for basic API
